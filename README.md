# osmdata-test

Test loading osmdata in another package. `travis-ci` identifies compilation
errors in importing `osmdata` that I can't seem to reproduce
([see examples here](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/osmplotr/jobs/244886520#L3758-L3789)),
so this repo is intended only to examine and fix these errors.
